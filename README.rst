Stop Motion Animation Studio
============================

The *kivy_camera1.py* program in this repo is a GUI tool for creating
stop motion animations. This project is pretty immature, but it has
been used to create some fun little animations.

This tool requires *kivy* GUI library and the *OpenCV* computer vision
library, so you must install these Python libraries/bindings prior to
running *kivy_camera1.py*.  Instructions on installing *kivy* can be
found in the *setup* section of the `kivytest README file`_.

To install *OpenCV* on Ubuntu 18.04, use this command: ::

  sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
